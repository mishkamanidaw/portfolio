		     <p></p>
		     I was accepted to do a summer internship for YCPC ( Youth Competitive programming circle)  my groupâ€™s job was to collaborate and get ahold of different tech companies around the bay area and set up field trips for unprivileged children in order to enlighten them with the wonders of technology.

Being born in South Africa and having the privilege of immigrating to California I wanted to give back and to help enrich South African youth with what I was able to learn in my years in America. I went to South Africa and helped out in a non-profit organization, I mainly answered phone calls and introduced children to google docs.  This amazing experience helped me find my passion for helping people, and my love for technology. I was able to see how different technology is in South Africa  compared to California. The littlest tech advancements that are so common in Americans everyday life were able to amaze these children. I hope to return and be able to teach them different programming languages, to enhance their knowledge and maybe even encourage them to pursue a career in computer science.
