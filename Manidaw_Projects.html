                    <p>This was the first project I did in my computer science engineering course. In this project we were able to using Scratch; an online programming language that people can use to create interactive stories, games, and animations
                    I have to admit it was not my best idea and didn't turn out 
                    too well. But the objective was to create a game or a story . My job in this project was to work on code and draw the pictures for our project. Some of the features you had to have were 
                    user interaction, an objective, and that the game should have included different states in order for the user to experience variety. 
                    In the process of creating our story I learned how to compromise and put me and my partner's ideas into one.
                    We tried to make our project very unique so we hand-drew the characters in our story, and tried
                    to come up with a "unique" storyline. This project really helped me explore the different 
                    features of Scratch, and made me understand the concept of using different blocks of code to create 
                    something much larger.</p>

                    <p> One of the projects that we did using the programming language, Python was our Hangman project, in this project our objective 
                    was to create a fully functional hangman game incorporating the hangman() function. Me and my partners decided to 
                    make the theme of our game Animals. At first this project confused me and I wasn't sure
                    how to begin it as time progressed I really learned to collaborate with my partners and problem solve
                    when we ran into different errors and challenges. Overall this project helped me understand
                    the fundamentals of Python and now I can create a working game with this programming
                    language. </p>

                    <p>In this project our objective was to design, model, and test hydrogen fuel cells 
                    and solar panel power for a vehicle and determine what works better. My responsibility for 
                    this project was to help build the design of my group's vehicle, work on documentation, and help figure
                    out which power source worked better, hydrogen fuel cells, or solar panel power. In this project my group and I
                    had to put together our ideas and create a lightweight vehicle that could move a meter. I was able to cooperate with 
                    my group and redesign our vehicle many times to create the most efficient vehicle possible.
