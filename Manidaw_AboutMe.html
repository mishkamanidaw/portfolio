                    <p> Hello my name is Mishka Manidaw and I am a sophomore at Dublin High School, and my graduation year is 2020. When I finish highschool I aspire to go into the computer science work field and acquire a job 
                   involving coding. In order to achieve my dream of becoming a Computer Engineer I plan on applying to another summer internship to enchance my 
                    cooperation and teamwork abilities. I also plan on taking additional computer science courses at Los Positas College before I graduate.
                    After graduation I hope to go to a college that specializes in technology such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology. </p>
                    
                    <p>Ever since I was little I have taken a liking to technology, specifically computers. My love for computers began with when my father and I would
                    work on building computers together. My knowledge for programming began when my fifth grade teacher, Mr. Hubbard introduced me to coding, and recommended doing
                    online courses while I was young. I feel like in this generation technology is becoming more and more common and before we 
                    know it everything in our world is going to be computer based, and I hope to be apart of enriching our society with the wonders of 
                    technology. </p>
                    
                    <p>Some of my strengths include having good interpersonal skills and being an excellent communicator. I also often volunteer my help to my family members and friends p
                    arents by updating their computers, and helping them 
                    load applications, and antivirus software because it is something I
                    enjoy doing and I have the patience to do it. It is also very rewarding afterward to know that I helped. I also always have a positive attitude and 
                    love to push people to their greatest abilities, when I was apart of the YCPC Internship I always encouraged my team members to 
                    persevere and put forth their best work in order to help acomplish our goal of introducing children to the field of computer science. 
                    I also have the ability to work under pressure, during the YCPC Internship there were lots of deadlines that we had to complete on time 
                    or else our project would not be completed, and I was able to complete the tasks to my best ability. 
                    <p> From my past experiences I've learnt that I love working in groups and cooperating with lots of people. The 
                    idea of having so many different perspectives make the experience more enjoyable. I love incorporating different ideas
                    and making different projects perfect. </p>
